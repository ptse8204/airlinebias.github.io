# Methodology
By using the data from US Census, specifically racial composition in a metropolitian area, we are able to determine groups that are privillege and disadvantaged in race. Which we define that as:

- Privillege Group: Metropolitian areas that has a higher-quantile proportion of caucassian race (white) in the distribution in US Census
- Protected Group: Metropolitian areas that has a lower-quantile proportion of caucassian race (white) in the distribution in US Census

We then pair these metropolitain area with the metropolitian areas defined in the DS1B dataset, and seperate the protected and the privillege groups in the database. 

# Results and Findings

## 35/65

<!-- add findings for checking anything that has privillege in either origin and destination, which would allow checking anything in between 35-65 -->
## 25/75
