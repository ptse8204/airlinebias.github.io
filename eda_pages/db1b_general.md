On average the variable is relatively stable, prior to the 2020 Q1, hovering between 26-27 cents in each quarter. There is a significant drop during the first 3 quarters of 2020 from the average of 25 cents to the lowest at 18 cents. The variable since then steadily rebound to 24 cents at the last quarter of 2021, and spike to the highest point in 2022 Q2 and Q3 of 28 cents.
