## Introduction

What are the thoughts when you are purchasing an flight ticket? Did you felt that you should be purchased it a bit earlier, or maybe a bit later so that prices would change? Though a lot of people knows that purchasing the fare at the last moment usually yield the highest price, it turns out that for average people, they purchase quite literally a very similar fare across the board. As our reaesrach shows, over 70% of all fares has a fare per mile of 20-30 cents.

We also found that most people are purchasing the median fare, rather than the highest fare or the lowest fare, as expected. These findings here helps aid our reasearch and model building the discover the bias related in the other sections.
