## Introduction and Abstracts of Findings

What are the thoughts when you are purchasing an flight ticket? Did you felt that you should be purchased it a bit earlier, or maybe a bit later so that prices would change? Though a lot of people knows that purchasing the fare at the last moment usually yield the highest price, it turns out that for average people, they purchase quite literally a very similar fare across the board. As our reaesrach shows, over 70% of all fares has a fare per mile of 20-30 cents.

We also found that most people are purchasing the median fare, rather than the highest fare or the lowest fare, as expected. These findings here helps aid our reasearch and model building the discover the bias related in the other sections.

Our scope of our data analysis spanned across over 5 years, from 2016 to until the Q3 of 2022 (the most current data when we have conducted the reaserach). In general, we discovered the significant impact of the pandemic to air travel and airfare prices, especially when comparing between pre-pandemic periods (2016-2019) with during the pandemic (2020-2021) and post-pandemic (2021-2022 Q3). Our other analysis found also found:
- Impact of flight distance on airfare
  - Ultra-short flights has a great impact on fare per mile
- Signifcant difference in fares between low-cost carriers and legacy carriers
  - Carriers defined as legacy carriers in our analysis are: American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Jetblue, and Hawaiian Airlines.
  - Carriers defined as low-cost carriers in our analysis are: Frontier, Spirit and Allegiant Airlines.
- No significant variance between quarters in years
- Flight prices were relatively stable, even without factoring in inflation prior to the pandemic
